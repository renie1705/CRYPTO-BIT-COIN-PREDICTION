This project is a web-based application developed using the Flask framework, designed to predict future Bitcoin (BTC) prices by analyzing historical market data through machine learning models. The primary goal is to offer users a simple yet powerful tool to gain insights into potential future price trends of Bitcoin. The application integrates real-time data fetching using the yfinance library, allowing it to retrieve up-to-date historical data such as opening price, closing price, volume, and other key financial indicators. It features clear and interactive visualizations powered by Matplotlib, enabling users to observe past trends and market behaviors in an intuitive way.

To forecast future prices, the system employs machine learning techniques—such as linear regression—to analyze the historical data and generate future predictions over a customizable period. The user interface includes secure login and registration functionalities to ensure personalized and protected access. Once predictions are generated, users have the option to download the results in CSV format for offline analysis or reporting purposes. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, offering a clean and responsive layout that works well across different devices.

Overall, this application serves as a practical tool for both beginners and enthusiasts in the fields of data science and cryptocurrency. It combines data analytics, machine learning, and web development in one comprehensive project, making it both educational and functional.
